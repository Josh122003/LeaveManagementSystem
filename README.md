The Student Leave Management System is a web-based platform developed 
to automate and simplify the process of managing student leave applications in 
educational settings. This system allows students to request leave electronically, while 
staff and faculty members can review, approve, or reject requests in a structured 
manner. The platform enhances transparency, accuracy, and efficiency in handling 
leave requests by reducing paperwork and manual data entry. 
Core features include an intuitive interface for submitting leave requests, 
categorization of leave types (medical, academic, personal, etc.), automated 
notifications to both students and staff regarding leave status, and integration with 
attendance records to ensure consistency. The system is customizable to institutional 
policies, allowing for rule enforcement regarding maximum leave limits, required 
approvals, and documentation. 
The Student Leave Management System offers significant advantages, such as 
improving communication between students and faculty, reducing the risk of lost or 
delayed applications, and enabling administrators to generate reports and analytics on 
leave patterns. By digitizing the leave process, institutions can optimize resource 
management and ensure a more organized approach to student attendance tracking.. 
By implementing the Student Leave Management System, educational institutions can 
enhance operational efficiency, minimize administrative errors, and provide students 
with a more transparent and accessible leave management process
